The following is an incomplete list of helpful tools that have aided our graduate school careers.  Emphasis has been place on open source and free software that is readily available to students at the University of Minnesota.

The organization of this follows the scientific workflow:

1. Learning
2. Doing
3. Communicating


## Learning

### Paper and Citation Management

- Mendeley
- EndNote
- RefWorks
- Zotereo
- CiteULike
- PaperPile

And there's this handy UMn proxy bookmarklet you can use to get access to papers while off of campus. Or just sign in through a UMn VPN

### RSS Feeds

- Feedly (Derek uses this, and likes it)

## Doing

### Planning and Executing

- Project Management Software
 - Trello
 - Asana
 - Basecamp
 - and others [...](http://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/1190/what-are-some-good-project-management-tools-for-academics) 

- Tracking your time you are spending on projects
 - Gleeo (Android specific)
 - Toggl (Web, iOS, Android)

### Keeping track of what you did
- Reproducible research
 - RMarkdown
 - IPython and Jupyter

- Lab notebook
 - either software
  - Evernote
  - OneNote
  - RedNotebook
 - Blog as a Notebook
  - Wordpress
  - Static Site generator (Jekyll, Derek uses Pelican)

- Version control
 - use git to track your projects
 - umn has enterprise git (unlimeted private repos), github.umn.edu
 - or use github.com and be open with your science (but think hard about doing that)

### Protecting your work // Backup

- storing your stuff in the cloud
 - Dropbox (Windows, Linux, Mac) -- allows you to work in folders and not think about it
 - Google Drive -- unlimited space at UMn
 - SpiderOak -- fully encrpyted data, don't lose your password

## Communication

### Papers / writing

- Word365
- Google Docs (include PaperPile for citations)
- LaTeX // overleaf (collaborative LaTeX writing)
- markdown, compiled by pandoc

### Figures
- R, base graphics, ggplot, ggvis ...
- python, packages go here .. seaborn?
- Inkscape
- d3.js

### Posters

- Inkscape again
- Scribus (Learning curve)
- LaTeX 

### Presentations

- Google slides
- R Markdown presentations

### Other outlets

- Twitter, make a science-specific account
- blog your stuff / science website
 - wordpress
 - static sites (Jekyll / Pelican)
  - host on github.io
  - host on Amazon EC2

## Misc

- Password Manager
 - KeePass2 (not in the cloud, you have the file ... that you can put in the cloud :/)
- Scheduling meetings
 - Doodle
 - WhenIsGood
- Planning Events
 - Google Forms
